+
Very good about late C++ syntax and tools
Some CPU/memory architecture information
Some algorithms/data structures

-
Async part at first interesting but it gets long and repetitive

2.5/5

+ A lot of concepts are introduced in mathematics and instruments and strategies

- A lot of mathematical results and other types of strategies are given 
very succinctly without much explanation, in depth exploration or demonstration.
So the result is often confusing and not helpful to be ready to start modelling.
It can be useful to know what exists and some basic concepts are explained.
